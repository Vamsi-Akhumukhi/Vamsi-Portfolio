    <description><![CDATA[<p>Nothing is more important than the World Cup in Football(Soccer). I made this viz to show Germany&rsquo;s dominance in Football.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Here are my analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>16 times finished as top 3 out of 19 tournaments played.</li>
<li>4 times Champions, 4 times Runners-up and 4 times finished Third.</li>
<li>Consistent in the last 80 years.</li>
<li>Impressive record of 59 Wins, 13 Losses and 6 Draws i.e. 75.64% winning ratio.</li>
<li>After each successful tournament, Germany had their worst performance in the following tournament, but with time they quickly bounced back to being champions again. Germany Finished as 22nd in 2018. By my analysis I can say that Germany will be Champions soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data is an art. Had a great time creating this art. The power of Tableau Software is impressive and mind blowing.
