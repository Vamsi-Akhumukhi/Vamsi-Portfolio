# Cristiano Ronaldo's Success

## Introduction
A boy from Maderia to Madrid. Why ?
To become the face of football.<!--more-->

Ronaldo played 9 seasons with Real Madrid, from 2009/10 to 2018/19. During his 9 years amazing career with Real Madrid.
He broke many records. So, I listed some of them after performing the analysis.

## Analysis



1) He scored 450 goals.
2) First player in the UEFA Champions League to reach 100 club goals.
3) Forget about players scoring 34 goals during their career, Ronaldo scored 34 career Hat-tricks with Real Madrid alone.
4) In a season, some clubs fail to reach 50+ goal mark, whereas, Ronaldo scored 61 goals in a season (2014/15).

My love for football and passion for analytics lead to this amazing work. Anyone can learn skills, but applying the knowledge and loving your work leads to success.
